                                <p>Returning to the rigors of academia after three years away wasn’t easy. Rebuilding structure, discipline, and stamina took grit—but I did it while juggling contract work and laying the groundwork for the next chapter of my career.</p>

At the intersection of healthcare and technology, I bridge worlds where computer programming meets pharmaceutical science. From public health to precision medicine, my journey has shown me that healthcare’s biggest challenges are often communication puzzles waiting to be solved.</p>

                                <p>I believe that knowledge should be as accessible as medicine itself. My philosophy is simple: empower, simplify, and illuminate. Through design, data, and dialogue, I aim to transform complex health information into stories that inform, inspire, and drive change.</p>

By exploring the emerging frontiers of healthcare informatics, data visualization, and programming, I strive to turn raw clinical data into insights that improve lives—one chart, one line of code, one person at a time.</p>
